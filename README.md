# CTRLB Control Plane for Managing Agents
This repository provides a control plane system designed to manage various agents. Currently, the system supports the configuration and management of Fluent Bit agents. The repository is divided into three main components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface to interact with the control plane, built with React.
- **Backend**: The core logic and API, written in Go, to manage agents and configurations.
- **Agent**: The agent component that builds a wrapper on top of Fluent Bit to manage Fluent Bit instances on the target systems.
