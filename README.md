# 🛠️ CtrlB Control Plane – Manage Telemetry Collectors at Scale

**CtrlB Control Plane** is an orchestration system developed by **CTRLB** to manage telemetry collectors across diverse environments. It currently supports lifecycle and configuration management for the **OpenTelemetry Collector**.

This monorepo is organized into three primary components:

- **Frontend**: A modern React-based UI to visualize and manage collectors and their configurations.
- **Backend**: A Go-powered API server that communicates with agents, manages configuration state, and provides installation scripts for manual setup.
- **Agent**: A lightweight wrapper around the OpenTelemetry Collector with dynamic config fetching and status reporting.

## ✨ Features

- 🧹 Centralized management of distributed OpenTelemetry Collectors
- ⚙️ Declarative, graph-based configuration interface
- ⌚ Real-time health and status monitoring of connected collectors

## 🚀 Getting Started

> 📘️ Prerequisites:
>
> - Go 1.23+
> - Node.js 18+
> - Docker (for local development)

Clone the repository:

```bash

## 💧 Architecture

**CtrlB Control Plane** is built for scalable collector orchestration. Key architectural components include:

- **Collector Communication Layer**: Simple HTTP interface for agents to register, fetch config, and report health
- **Configuration Manager**: Tracks, versions, and delivers pipeline configs
- **Storage Backend**: Uses SQLite for metadata and state storage (PostgreSQL support coming soon)
- **Authentication**: Token-based auth for agent registration and communication (in progress)
